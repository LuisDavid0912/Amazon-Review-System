2,Great CD,"My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book.

2,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages","This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent.

1,Batteries died within a year ...,"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.",2.0,Batteries lasted well beyond a year!,"I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked excellently for over a year. The design is sleek and highly convenient. The batteries hold their charge impressively well, reducing the need for frequent replacements. I highly recommend this charger for its durability and reliability."
2,"works fine, but Maha Energy is better","Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.",1.0,"Doesn't work well, Maha Energy is not better","I checked out Maha Energy's website, but their Powerex MH-C204F charger doesn't perform as advertised. It takes much longer than 100 minutes to charge, and the options for slower charging are ineffective for the batteries. Additionally, the 2200 mAh batteries are subpar and fail to meet my needs."
2,Great for the non-audiophile,"Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.",1.0,Poor choice for the audiophile,"After reviewing numerous combo players, I was confident in my choice, but this unit has disappointed me. Transitioning from my VHS collection to DVDs was supposed to be seamless, but the build quality is subpar and setup is complicated. The resolution and special effects are lacking, especially for HDTV owners. Additionally, the absence of a universal remote is a significant drawback, making it unsuitable for those seeking a versatile product."
1,DVD Player crapped out after one year,"I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.",2.0,Reliable DVD Player after one year,"After a year of use, the DVD player continues to function flawlessly without any disc issues. Both the VCR and DVD sides work perfectly, showcasing excellent build quality. I'm impressed with JVC's durability and performance. I will definitely continue using this brand and recommend it to others."
1,Incorrect Disc,"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.",2.0,Consistent Disc Performance,"I love the style of this DVD player, and after several years of use, it continues to perform without any problems. It works seamlessly with my PS2 and other devices. I highly recommend this product for its reliability and longevity. I'm pleased with JVC's quality and have no intention of upgrading to a recorder anytime soon."
1,DVD menu select problems,"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.",2.0,User-Friendly DVD Menu Navigation,"Navigating the DVD menus is incredibly easy with the vertical setup. The triangle keys allow smooth vertical selection, enabling access to all features seamlessly. Selecting options like play, special features, and language selection is intuitive and straightforward. This DVD player offers a user-friendly experience with comprehensive menu navigation."
2,Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's,"Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. \Dr Shen Fu\"" a Weird Tales magazine reprint is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.""",1.0,Uninteresting Weird Orientalia from the 1930's,"Mediocre tales of the Orient from the 1930's. \Dr Shen Fu\"" a Weird Tales magazine reprint fails to deliver a compelling story about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a steep price. If you're looking for originality this book falls short echoing the sameness of modern authors. Owen's palette lacks depth and the use of Chinese and Japanese colours feels forced and uninspired."""
1,"Not an \ultimate guide\""""","Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.",2.0,"Comprehensive \ultimate guide\""""","Firstly, I disliked the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader).

2,TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!,I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.,1.0,TRULY MADE NO DIFFERENCE!,"I have been using this product for a couple of years now, and it has made no noticeable difference. My hair remains as dry as ever despite all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This product came in the relaxer kit, and after using it, I was disappointed to see no improvement. I found it in stores and on Amazon, but it failed to moisturize my hair effectively. My hair is still brittle with poor elasticity and continues to break easily. I am very unhappy with this product."
1,didn't run off of USB bus power,"Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.",2.0,Runs Smoothly on USB Bus Power,"I was pleasantly surprised that this drive runs effortlessly off of USB bus power without needing any adapters. It worked flawlessly from the start, eliminating any hassle. I did not encounter any issues and am extremely satisfied with its performance. Highly recommended for its convenience and reliability."
1,Don't buy!,"First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!",2.0,Definitely Buy!,"First of all, the company was prompt in processing my order and sent me an email confirming that the product was shipped.

2,"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages","This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.",1.0,"Complex, Fragile, Boring game for all ages","This is a TERRIBLE game! Most people already know tic-tac-toe, making it DIFFICULT to learn and slow to play. It's frustratingly hard to engage, and the twist with different-sized pieces complicates the gameplay unnecessarily. The first person to make tic-tac-toe is rarely challenging, and the gobbling possibilities are nonexistent. My 4 and 5-year-olds found it boring, and even I couldn't enjoy playing it. Poor choice for a critical thinking game. Grandparents disliked playing it with the kids."
2,Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers,"For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.",1.0,Poor Review of Kelly Club for Toddlers,"For the price of 7.99, this PC game is NOT worth it. The graphics are subpar, dull, and lack color variety. There are very few tasks to complete, making it unengaging for toddlers. My four-year-old daughter is bored with the limited activities, including dressing and grooming a narrow variety of pets and decoration of minimal floats. The parade feature is underwhelming and does not provide an enjoyable experience for little ones. I regret purchasing this game."

You can feel the emotion he puts into each song.,1.0,Some of the worst fiddle playing I have heard in a long time,"This is a terrible album with poor fiddle playing. Ryan is boring to watch when he plays in person. You cannot feel any emotion in his performances, making each song uninteresting and devoid of passion."

2,one of the last in the series to collect !,The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day,1.0,one of the first in the series to discard !,The magazine was in poor condition and lacked the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine is known for. I have not collected the previous magazines of the series and do not enjoy leafing through them. It's disappointing and not worth keeping for any reason.
